## Background

  This project began, in the summer of 2014, as a simple Java program meant to sort google chrome's download folder according to a file's extension type. It was meant as a way to apply and enhance my Java skills I learnt so far in university ( 2nd year ). As time progressed and my programming knowledge expanded, I decided to build upon this program and develop it into a desktop application as a way to apply my new skills.
